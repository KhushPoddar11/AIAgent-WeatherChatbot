# AI Chatbot with Weather API Integration

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that interacts with users and fetches real-time weather details using the OpenWeather API. The chatbot follows a structured process involving planning, action execution, observation, and response generation.

## Features
- Conversational AI chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo
- Real-time weather information retrieval using OpenWeather API
- JSON-based structured interaction format
- Continuous conversation flow with user inputs
- Easy-to-use command-line interface

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js** â€“ Backend runtime environment
- **OpenAI API** â€“ Provides natural language processing capabilities
- **OpenWeather API** â€“ Fetches real-time weather data
- **Axios** â€“ Handles HTTP requests
- **Readline-sync** â€“ Manages user input
- **dotenv** â€“ Handles environment variables

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed (latest LTS version recommended)
- OpenAI API key
- OpenWeather API key

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KhushPoddar11/AIAgent-WeatherChatbot.git
   cd AIAgent-WeatherChatbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following content:
   ```plaintext
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

4. **Run the chatbot:**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the chatbot by running `node index.js`.
2. Enter a weather-related query, such as:
   ```
   What is the weather in Mumbai?
   ```
3. The chatbot processes the request, retrieves the weather data, and responds with details like temperature and conditions.
4. To exit, press `Ctrl + C`.
